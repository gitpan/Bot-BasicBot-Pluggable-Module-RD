NAME
    Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable::Module::RD - RecDescent grammar adaptor plugin

SYNOPSIS
      !load RD

    See the synopsis of Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable for how to load this
    plugin.

DESCRIPTION
    Many bots are concerned with responding to commands issued on IRC. The
    simple approach of regular expressions is used by many of the bot
    plugins. However, this module offers full syntax parsing via
    Parse::RecDescent.

    Rather than each bot plugin doing its own parsing in an overridden
    "said()" routine, the approach used here is for a single grammar shared
    between the bot plugins. This module and namespace is the keeper of the
    grammar, and others can extend the grammar by adding rules to it.

    The following simple commands are provided:

      say Hello channel
      tell ivorw I'm connected

  Methods "init", "told", "help"
    See the documentation for Bot::BasicBot::Pluggable::Module and
    Bot::BasicBot.

  extend
    This is called by any pluggable modules in order to add rules to the
    bot's Parse::RecDescent grammar.
